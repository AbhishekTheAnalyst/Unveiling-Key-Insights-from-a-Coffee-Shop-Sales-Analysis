# Unveiling-Key-Insights-from-a-Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis

Iâ€™m delighted to share a recent project where I dove deep into the data of a coffee shopâ€™s sales and I have designed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to extract valuable insights for driving business strategies.

**Analysis:**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**DAX in Power BI:** 

- **Data Transformation**: Used Power Query, to clean and transform the raw data into a structured format.
  
- **Advanced Calculations**: Utilised DAX to create custom measures and calculations in order to bring a new dimension to my analysis and generate valuable insights.

**ðŸ”‘ Valuable Insights:**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1. Balanced Location Performance:**

All three locations - Hell's Kitchen, Astoria, and Lower Manhattan are all contributing almost equally to the total revenue with Hellâ€™s Kitchen slightly ahead at 33.84%.

**2. Top-Performing Categories:**

Coffee and tea emerge as the top-performing product categories with sales of $0.27M and $0.20M, respectively. On the other hand, packaged chocolate isn't performing as well, highlighting a potential area for improvement or diversification.

**3. Revenue Drivers:**

Brewed Chai Tea, Espresso, and Gourmet Brewed Coffee are the top revenue-generating products, with Espresso leading the pack.

**4. Sales Peaks:**

May was a standout month, with a 31.77% increase in sales over April. Additionally, sales tend to peak during the morning rush from 7 am to 10 am.

**ðŸ’¡ Recommendations:**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**â€¢	Optimize Staffing & Resources:**

Allocate more staff and resources during peak hours (7 am to 10 am) to meet demand efficiently.

**â€¢	Targeted Marketing:**

Launch special promotions during peak hours to capitalize on high traffic to maximize revenue.

**â€¢	Inventory Management:**

I can recommend the company to ensure popular products are well-stocked during high-demand periods to avoid stockouts.
